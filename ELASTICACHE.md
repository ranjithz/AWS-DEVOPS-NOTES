# ELASTICACHE

You can use ElastiCache for caching, which accelerates application and database performance, or as a primary data store for use cases that don't require durability like session stores, gaming leaderboards, streaming, and analytics. ElastiCache is compatible with Redis and Memcached.

## CLUSTER : 

A group of two or more computers, or nodes, that run in parallel to achieve a common goal. This allows workloads consisting of a high number of individual, parallelizable tasks to be distributed among the nodes in the cluster.

## MEMCACHED CLUSTER : 

Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is available in multiple AWS Regions around the world. Thus, you can launch ElastiCache clusters in the locations that meet your business requirements. For example, you can launch in the AWS Region closest to your customers or to meet certain legal requirements.
The default Memcached port is 11211. ElastiCache uses that subnet group to choose a subnet and IP addresses within that subnet to associate with your nodes.
